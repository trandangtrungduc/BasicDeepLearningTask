# Basic Deep Learning Task

[//]: # (Logo)

### Overview
- These are useful projects for beginners and intermediates to approaching Deep Learning. Each ipynb file is a different topic (lesson).
- Dependency: Python and some other libraries are listed in each document (ipynb files).

### Implementation
1. Natural language processing project: Exploratory data analysis, pre-process, classification models, unsupervised technique, including GridSearchCV, topic modeling (Author_Classification.ipynb).
    - Pre-process:
        - Bag of word.
        - Term Frequence-Inverse Document Frequency.
        - Word to vector.
    - Classification:
        - Naive Bayes.
        - Logistic Regression.
        - Decision Tree
        - Random Forest.
        - K - Nearest Neighbors.
        - Supoprt Vector Machine
        - Gradient Boosting.
        - Recurrent Neural Networks.
    - Unsupervised technique:
        - K - Means.
        - Agglomerative.
        - Gaussian Mixture.
    - Topic modeling:
        - Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
        - Latent Semantic Analysis.
        - Non-Negative Factorization
3. Image processing project: Exploratory data analysis and fruit classification with Convolution and LSTM (Fruit_Classification.ipynb).
4. Natural language processing project: Exploratory data analysis, pre-process, apply sequence to sequence and BERT models to data(Watson_project.ipynb).
5. Natural language processing project: Rule-based chat bot with TD-IDF and Bag of words(Chatbot.ipynb).
